# LLM-Slim-Models

SLIM stands for Structured Language Instruction Models.
Small language models (SLMs) are artificial intelligence (AI) models capable of processing, understanding and generating natural language content. 
As their name implies, SLMs are smaller in scale and scope than large language models (LLMs).
